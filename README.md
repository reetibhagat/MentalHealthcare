CASE STUDY OVERVIEW
https://www.sas.com/en_us/customers/camh.html

Case Background:
Brief Introduction about Mental Illness and Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)
 My case study is based on the efforts taken my CAMH (Canadian based mental healthcare center) to remove stigma from mental illness and addiction and providing care to mentally ill patients.  Mental illness is the condition that affects thinking, behavior and mood. It can be dementia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders etc. In Canada, there is ratio of 1 in 5 people having mental illness and CAMH is focused on delivering to care to mentally ill people who are not able to receive world class care.
 I identified three major problems faced by CAMH. They are as follows:
1.	Increase patient flow in emergency department by 82% in the last 6 years
2.	the ALC (i.e., alternative level of care: patients who are occupying an acute care hospital bed but are not in need of inpatient medical service) patients who occupies the bed for longer time.
3.	 Due to increased number of patients and limited resources in CAMH, need to additional clinic to accompany new patients.

Case Summary: 
CAMH could use this valuable information to improve clinical outcomes and streamline operations.  Their aim is predicting the number of patient so that they can devise the right care models and process optimization models to accommodate future needs.  Also, identifying the ALC patient is or not, helps to optimize the bed space
